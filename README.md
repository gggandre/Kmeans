# Kmeans

### TUTORIAL LINK https://github.com/gggandre/Kmeans/assets/84719490/791cf797-b2e3-4436-b6c3-f84aa253459d

## Initialization:
- A number k is set, representing the desired number of clusters.
- k random points from the dataset are chosen as the initial centroids.

## Assignment of Points to Centroids:
- For each point in the dataset, the distance to each of the k centroids is calculated.
- Each point is assigned to the nearest centroid.

## Recalculation of Centroids:
- Once all points have been assigned to a centroid, the centroids are recalculated.
- The new centroid is simply the average of all points assigned to that cluster.
- If any centroid has no assigned points (which is rare but can happen), it is reset by choosing a random point from the dataset as the new centroid.

## Convergence:
- These steps are repeated until centroids no longer change between consecutive iterations or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.
- When the algorithm converges, we have our final clusters.

## KMeans is a clustering algorithm, not a supervised classification algorithm. Therefore, typical metrics for supervised 
## Classification like precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix are not directly applicable.
## Instead, to evaluate the clusters generated by the KMeans algorithm, the following metrics are used:
1. Inertia (WCSS - Within-Cluster Sum of Squares): Measures how cohesive the clusters are. It's the sum of the squared distances of each point to its centroid. The aim is to minimize this metric.
2. Silhouette Score: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The value ranges between -1 and 1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched with neighboring clusters.
3. Calinski-Harabasz Index: It's the ratio of dispersion within the cluster and dispersion between clusters. Higher values indicate better clusters.
4. Davies-Bouldin Index: This metric indicates the average similarity of each cluster with the most similar cluster. Lower values indicate better clusters.
## These metrics were calculated for both the training and validation datasets to ensure the model generalizes well.


# Run code

1. Clone the repo or download the .zip
